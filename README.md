Be sure to also check out the [Dalamud Developer Docs][dalamud-docs] for helpful information about building your own plugin. The Developer Docs includes helpful information about all sorts of things, including [how to submit][submit] your newly-created plugin to the official repository. Assuming you use this template repository, the provided project build configuration and license are already chosen to make everything a breeze.

Build the solution. By default, this will build a `Debug` build, but you can switch to `Release` in your IDE.
The resulting plugin can be found at `SamplePlugin/bin/x64/Debug/SamplePlugin.dll` (or `Release` if appropriate.)

Basically, just replace all references to `SamplePlugin` in all of the files and filenames with your desired name, then start building the plugin of your dreams. You'll figure it out üòÅ

Dalamud will load the JSON file (by default, `SamplePlugin/SamplePlugin.json`) next to your DLL and use it for metadata, including the description for your plugin in the Plugin Installer. Make sure to update this with information relevant to _your_ plugin!
